ABSTRACT = {In drill-seeded, delay-flooded organic rice production, reliable predictions of N supply from cover crop (CC) residues to subsequent rice are still a challenge. An incubation was conducted to determine the effects of CC types (clover, ryegrass, clover and ryegrass mixtures, and fallow), residue application rates (0, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4%) and incubation time on soil CO2 evolution and N mineralization and availability. The cumulative CO2 evolution linearly increased with increasing residue rate. Compared to the control, adding CCs residue significantly increased the cumulative CO2 emission, which was greatest in soils with clover or mixtures of clover and ryegrass, followed by fallow, and lowest in soils with ryegrass. The modeling results indicated clover had the greatest initial C and N mineralization rates and the shortest half-lives. A temporary decrease in soil mineral N caused by immobilization occurred at the initial incubation stage in all treatments. However, the trend reversed progressively, with the clover treatment requiring the shortest time to meet the crossover point. The results suggested clover was the optimal CC type, 0.6% was the optimal residue rate, and a minimum of 27 days between CC termination and rice planting was required to maximize mineral N supply for organic rice.},
