# Project Management {#sec-git}

Many tutorials are available in different formats. Here is a [YouTube video
``Git and GitHub for Beginners --- Crash
Course''](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk).
The video also covers GitHub, a cloud service for Git which provides a cloud
back up of your work and makes collaboration with co-workers easy. Similar
services are, for example, [bitbucket](bitbucket.org) and [GitLab](gitlab.com).


There are tools that make learning Git easy. 

+ Here is a collection of
  [online Git exersices](https://gitexercises.fracz.com)
  that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught.
+ Here is a game called [`Oh My Git`](https://ohmygit.org), an open
  source game about learning Git!



## Set Up Git/GitHub

Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't have it already.

To set up GitHub (other services like Bitbucket or GitLab are similar),
you need to

+ Generate an SSH key if you don't have one already.
+ Sign up an GitHub account.
+ Add the SSH key to your GitHub account

See [how to get started with GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account).

## Most Frequently Used Git Commands

The following seven commands will get you started and they may be all
that you need most of the time.

+ `git clone`:
    + Used to clone a repository to a local folder.
    + Requires either HTTPS link or SSH key to authenticate. 
+ `git pull`:
    + Downloads any updates made to the remote repository and automatically updates the local repository.
+ `git status`: 
    + Returns the state of the working directory. 
    + Lists the files that have been modified, and are yet to be or have been staged and/or committed. 
    + Shows if the local repository is begind or ahead a remote branch.
+ `git add`:
    + Adds new or modified files to the Git staging area. 
    + Gives the option to select which files are to be sent to the remote repository
+ `git rm`: 
    + Used to remove files from the staging index or the local repository. 
+ `git commit`: 
    + Commits changes made to the local repository and saves it like a snapshot. 
    + A message is recommended with every commit to keep track of changes made.
+ `git push`:
    + Used to send commits made on local repository to the remote repository. 


For more advanced usages:

+ `git diff`
+ `git branch`
+ `git reset`


## Tips on using Git:

+ Use the command line interface instead of the web interface 
  (e.g., upload on GitHub)
+ Make frequent small commits instead of rare large commits.
+ Make commit messages informative and meaningful.
+ Name your files/folders by some reasonable convention. 
    - Lower cases are better than upper cases.
    - No blanks in file/folder names.
+ Keep the repo clean by not tracking generated files.
+ Creat a `.gitignore` file for better output from `git status`.
+ Keep the linewidth of sources to under 80 for better `git diff` view.


## Pull Request
To contribute to an open source project (e.g., our classnotes), use pull
requests. [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
"let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on
GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential
changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are
merged into the base branch."

Watch this YouTube video: [GitHub pull requests in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/8lGpZkjnkt4).

The following are step-by-step instructions on how to make a pull
request to the class notes contributed by **Nick Pfeifer**..

+ Create a fork of the class repository on the GitHub website.
    + Make sure your fork is up to date by clicking **Sync fork** if necessary.
+ Clone your fork into a folder on your computer.
    + `git clone https://github.com/GitHub_Username/ids-s26.git`
    + Replace **GitHub_Username** with your personal GitHub Username.
+ Check to see if you can access the folder/cloned repository in your code editor.
    + The class notes home page is located in the index.qmd file.
+ Make a branch and give it a good name.
    + Move into the directory with the cloned repository.
    + Create a branch using:
        + `git checkout -b branch_name`
        + Replace **branch_name** with a more descriptive name.
    + You can check your branches using:
        + `git branch`
        + The branch in use will have an asterisk to the left of it.
    + If you are not in the right branch you can use the following command:
        + `git checkout existing-branch`
        + Replace **existing-branch** with the name of the branch you want to use.
+ Run `git status` to verify that no changes have been made.
+ Make changes to a file in the class notes repository.
    + For example: add your wishes to the Wishlist in index.qmd using nested list syntax in markdown.
    + Remember to save your changes.
+ Run `git status` again to see that changes have been made.
+ Use the add command.
    + `git add filename`
    + Example usage: `git add index.qmd`
+ Make a commit.
    + `git commit -m "Informative Message"`
    + Be clear about what you changed and perhaps include your name in the message.
+ Push the files to GitHub.
    + `git push origin branch-name`
    + Replace **branch-name** with the name of your current branch.
+ Go to your forked repository on GitHub and refresh the page, 
you should see a button that says **Compare and Pull Request**.
    + Describe the changes you made in the pull request.
    + Click **Create pull request**.
