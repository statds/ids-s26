## Data Science Ethics

### Introduction
Ethics in data science is a fundamental consideration
throughout the lifecycle of any project. Data science ethics
refers to the principles and practices that guide responsible
and fair use of data to ensure that individual rights are
respected, societal welfare is prioritized, and harmful
outcomes are avoided. Ethical frameworks like the Belmont
Report [@belmont1979]} and regulations such as the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
[@hipaa1996] have established foundational principles
that inspire ethical considerations in research and data use.
This section explores key principles of ethical data science
and provides guidance on implementing these principles in
practice.

### Principles of Ethical Data Science

#### Respect for Privacy
Safeguarding privacy is critical in data science. Projects
should comply with data protection regulations, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Techniques like anonymization
and pseudonymization must be applied to protect sensitive
information. Beyond legal compliance, data scientists should
consider the ethical implications of using personal data.

The principles established by the Belmont Report
emphasize respect for persons, which aligns with safeguarding
individual privacy. Protecting privacy also involves limiting
data collection to what is strictly necessary. Minimizing the
use of identifiable information and implementing secure data
storage practices are essential steps. Transparency about
how data is used further builds trust with stakeholders.

##### Example: Netflix Prize Data

Netflix released an ``anonymized''' movie-rating dataset for a public competition; researchers later showed individuals could be re-identified by linking a few ratings to public profiles or IMDB reviews. 

Other examples: 
    + Mobility/location traces indentify individuals
    + Financial transanctions 
    + Health/EHR data leaks via ZIP + birthdate + sex

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Take-home message (click to expand)"}
 + “Removing names” isn’t enough. High-dimensional behavioral data can be re-identified, so share less, aggregate more, and assess re-identification risk before releasing data.
 + Need aggregration, differential privacy, etc.

#### Commitment to Fairness
Bias can arise at any stage of the data science pipeline,
from data collection to algorithm development. Ethical
practice requires actively identifying and addressing biases
to prevent harm to underrepresented groups. Fairness should
guide the design and deployment of models, ensuring
equitable treatment across diverse populations.

To achieve fairness, data scientists must assess datasets
for representativeness and use tools to detect potential
biases. Regular evaluation of model outcomes against
fairness metrics helps ensure that systems remain
non-discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) [@ada1990] provides a legal framework emphasizing
equitable access, which can inspire fairness in algorithmic
design. Collaborating with domain experts and stakeholders
can provide additional insights into fairness issues.

##### Example: Bias in Predictive modeling 

We want to train a model for predicting suicide risk with EHR data. Is a model that can predict with 97% accuracy good?  

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Take-home message (click to expand)"}
 + Training data could be very unbalanced. In this problem, it is likely that the number of cases in the data is less than 3%. So a naive model that always predicts ``0'' can easily reach 97% accuracy.
 + Model accuracy high overall but terrible for minorities
 + Better model evaluation and bias awareness/adjustment.
:::

Other examples: 
 + Face recognition errors by skin tone. 
 + Lending/credit scoring bias.
 + Bias in generative models such as LLMs. 


#### Emphasis on Transparency
Transparency builds trust and accountability in data
science. Models should be interpretable, with clear
documentation explaining their design, assumptions, and
decision-making processes. Data scientists must communicate
results in a way that stakeholders can understand, avoiding
unnecessary complexity or obfuscation.

Transparent practices include providing stakeholders access
to relevant information about model performance and
limitations. The Federal Data Strategy [@fds2019] calls
for transparency in public sector data use, offering
inspiration for practices in broader contexts. Visualizing
decision pathways and using tools like LIME or SHAP can
enhance interpretability. Establishing clear communication
protocols ensures that non-technical audiences can engage
with the findings effectively.


##### Example: deep learning vs. logistic regression 

Which would you deploy in a hospital triage setting if they have similar performance? 


#### Focus on Social Responsibility
Data science projects must align with ethical goals and
anticipate their broader societal and environmental impacts.
This includes considering how outputs may be used or
misused and avoiding harm to vulnerable populations. Data
scientists should aim to use their expertise to promote
public welfare, addressing critical societal challenges such
as health disparities, climate change, and education access.

Engaging with diverse perspectives helps align projects with
societal values. Ethical codes, such as those from the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [@acm2018],
offer guidance on using technology for social good.
Collaborating with policymakers and community
representatives ensures that data-driven initiatives address
real needs and avoid unintended consequences. Regular impact
assessments help measure whether projects meet their ethical
objectives.

##### Example: Predictive policing feedback loop

    + Police send patrols where past arrests are high
    + More patrols lead to more arrests
    + Model ``learns'' area has more crime

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Take-home message (click to expand)"}
 + Data $\neq$ ground truth
 + Feedback loops amplify inequality
:::

Other examples:
    + Recommender systems used by social media platforms
    + Insurance pricing penalizing poor neighborhoods


#### Adherence to Professional Integrity
Professional integrity underpins all ethical practices in
data science. Adhering to established ethical guidelines,
such as those from the American Statistical Association
(ASA) [@asa2018], ensures accountability. Practices like
maintaining informed consent, avoiding data manipulation,
and upholding rigor in analyses are essential for
maintaining public trust in the field.

Ethical integrity also involves fostering a culture of
honesty and openness within data science teams. Peer review
and independent validation of findings can help identify
potential errors or biases. Documenting methodologies and
maintaining transparency in reporting further strengthen
trust.

##### Examples

 + p-hacking
 + cherry picking
 + misleading graphs
 + no reproducibility


### Ensuring Ethics in Practice

#### Building Ethical Awareness
Promoting ethical awareness begins with education and
training. Institutions should integrate ethics into data
science curricula, emphasizing real-world scenarios and
decision-making. Organizations should conduct regular
training to ensure their teams remain informed about
emerging ethical challenges.

Workshops and case studies can help data scientists
understand the complexities of ethical decision-making.
Providing access to resources, such as ethical guidelines
and tools, supports continuous learning. Leadership support
is critical for embedding ethics into organizational culture.

#### Embedding Ethics in Workflows
Ethics must be embedded into every stage of the data science
pipeline. Establishing frameworks for ethical review, such
as ethics boards or peer-review processes, helps identify
potential issues early. Tools for bias detection,
explainability, and privacy protection should be standard
components of workflows.

Standard operating procedures for ethical reviews can
formalize the consideration of ethics in project planning.
Developing templates for documenting ethical decisions
ensures consistency and accountability. Collaboration across
teams enhances the ability to address ethical challenges
comprehensively.

#### Establishing Accountability Mechanisms
Clear accountability mechanisms are essential for ethical
governance. This includes maintaining documentation for all
decisions, establishing audit trails, and assigning
responsibility for the outputs of data-driven systems.
Organizations should encourage open dialogue about ethical
concerns and support whistleblowers who raise issues.

Periodic audits of data science projects help ensure
compliance with ethical standards. Organizations can benefit
from external reviews to identify blind spots and improve
their practices. Accountability fosters trust and aligns
teams with ethical objectives.

#### Engaging Stakeholders
Ethical data science requires collaboration with diverse
stakeholders. Including perspectives from affected
communities, policymakers, and interdisciplinary experts
ensures that projects address real needs and avoid
unintended consequences. Stakeholder engagement fosters
trust and aligns projects with societal values.

Public consultations and focus groups can provide valuable
feedback on the potential impacts of data science projects.
Engaging with regulators and advocacy groups helps align
projects with legal and ethical expectations. Transparent
communication with stakeholders builds long-term
relationships.

#### Continuous Improvement
Ethics in data science is not static; it evolves with
technology and societal expectations. Continuous improvement
requires regular review of ethical practices, learning from
past projects, and adapting to new challenges.
Organizations should foster a culture of reflection and
growth to remain aligned with ethical best practices.

Establishing mechanisms for feedback on ethical practices
can identify areas for development. Sharing lessons learned
through conferences and publications helps the broader
community advance its understanding of ethics in data
science.

### Conclusion
Data science ethics is a dynamic and integral aspect of the
discipline. By adhering to principles of privacy, fairness,
transparency, social responsibility, and integrity, data
scientists can ensure their work contributes positively to
society. Implementing these principles through structured
workflows, stakeholder engagement, and continuous
improvement establishes a foundation for trustworthy and
impactful data science.
